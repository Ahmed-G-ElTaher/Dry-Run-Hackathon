# Quantum Computing for Weather Forecasting in Cairo: Problem Summary

## Problem Overview

The challenge focuses on leveraging quantum computing to enhance weather forecasting accuracy for Cairo, Egypt. Weather forecasting is a complex task due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems, requiring significant computational power to process large datasets and model intricate patterns. Traditional forecasting methods struggle with the computational intensity and precision needed for long-term predictions. Quantum computing offers potential advantages through its ability to handle complex optimization, pattern recognition, and probabilistic modeling, which could improve the accuracy and efficiency of weather predictions for Cairo's unique climate.

The goal is to explore quantum algorithms (e.g., quantum machine learning, optimization, or simulation) to analyze historical weather data and predict key meteorological variables such as temperature, precipitation, or wind speed. This could involve developing quantum models to identify patterns, optimize forecasting algorithms, or reduce computational time compared to classical methods.

## Dataset Description

The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yousefelshahat2/cairo-whether), contains daily weather data for Cairo from February 1, 2009, to February 1, 2025. It includes various meteorological variables, enabling analysis of historical weather patterns to inform forecasting models. The data is stored in a CSV file named `Cairo-Weather.csv`.

### Key Elements of the Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns, each representing a specific weather-related metric:

- **time**: Date of the observation (e.g., "2/1/2009").
- **temperature_2m_mean (¬∞C)**: Average temperature at 2 meters above ground.
- **rain_sum (mm)**: Total rainfall for the day.
- **wind_speed_10m_max (km/h)**: Maximum wind speed at 10 meters above ground.
- **apparent_temperature_mean (¬∞C)**: Average "feels-like" temperature, accounting for humidity and wind.
- **temperature_2m_min (¬∞C)**: Minimum temperature at 2 meters.
- **temperature_2m_max (¬∞C)**: Maximum temperature at 2 meters.
- **apparent_temperature_max (¬∞C)**: Maximum "feels-like" temperature.
- **weather_code (wmo code)**: World Meteorological Organization code indicating weather conditions (e.g., 0 for clear, 51 for light rain).
- **wind_direction_10m_dominant (¬∞)**: Dominant wind direction in degrees.
- **wind_gusts_10m_max (km/h)**: Maximum wind gust speed.
- **shortwave_radiation_sum (MJ/m¬≤)**: Total shortwave solar radiation received.
- **daylight_duration (s)**: Duration of daylight in seconds.
- **sunshine_duration (s)**: Duration of direct sunshine in seconds.
- **apparent_temperature_min (¬∞C)**: Minimum "feels-like" temperature.
- **sunrise (iso8601)**: Time of sunrise in ISO8601 format.
- **sunset (iso8601)**: Time of sunset in ISO8601 format.
- **precipitation_hours (h)**: Number of hours with precipitation.
- **precipitation_sum (mm)**: Total precipitation (rain + other forms).
- **et0_fao_evapotranspiration (mm)**: Reference evapotranspiration per FAO standards.
- **snowfall_sum (cm)**: Total snowfall (0 cm in Cairo due to its climate).
- **cloud_cover_mean (%)**: Average cloud cover percentage.

### Data Characteristics

- **Time Span**: February 1, 2009, to February 1, 2025 (daily records).
- **Data Points**: Approximately 5,840 rows (16 years of daily data).
- **Missing Values**: Visibility columns (`visibility_mean`, `visibility_max`, `visibility_min`) are entirely NaN, indicating missing or undefined data.
- **Notable Features**:
    - Cairo's climate is arid, with minimal precipitation (e.g., `rain_sum` and `precipitation_sum` are often 0, with rare exceptions).
    - `snowfall_sum` is consistently 0 cm, as expected for Cairo's desert climate.
    - Temperature variables show seasonal variations, with higher values in summer (e.g., max temperatures up to 37.6¬∞C in April 2009) and lower in winter (e.g., min temperatures around 7.9¬∞C in February 2009).
    - Wind-related metrics (e.g., `wind_speed_10m_max`, `wind_gusts_10m_max`) indicate occasional high winds, with gusts up to 73.1 km/h (March 7, 2009).
    - `weather_code` provides categorical data for weather conditions, useful for classification tasks.

## Potential Quantum Computing Applications

- **Quantum Machine Learning**: Use quantum algorithms (e.g., quantum support vector machines or quantum neural networks) to predict variables like `temperature_2m_mean` or `precipitation_sum` based on historical patterns.
- **Optimization**: Apply quantum optimization algorithms (e.g., QAOA) to optimize model parameters for forecasting or to select the most relevant features from the dataset.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Leverage quantum algorithms to identify complex patterns in multi-variable data (e.g., correlations between `wind_speed`, `temperature`, and `cloud_cover`).
- **Simulation**: Use quantum simulation to model atmospheric dynamics, potentially improving the resolution of weather predictions.


## üè∫ Challenge Track 3: Quantum Computing for Archaeological Site Discovery in Egypt
![](https://github.com/Ahmed-G-ElTaher/Dry-Run-Hackathon/blob/main/Images/20250728_2019_Quantum%20Archaeology%20Optimization_simple_compose_01k190n8jdfgrbmhd96kp11y5z.png)
Egypt harbors an estimated 70% of the world's archaeological treasures, yet only a fraction have been excavated due to the immense challenge of locating sites buried beneath millennia of Nile sediment and desert sand. With over 500 potential archaeological sites identified through preliminary AI analysis, Egypt faces a critical optimization problem: how to efficiently prioritize, validate, and excavate these sites given limited resources, expertise, and time.
Current archaeological prospection methods suffer from computational bottlenecks when processing multi-terabyte satellite imagery, complex geophysical sensor arrays, and heterogeneous historical datasets. The combinatorial complexity of optimizing excavation sequences, considering factors such as site accessibility, historical significance, preservation urgency, and logistical constraints, presents an ideal application for quantum computing advantages.
